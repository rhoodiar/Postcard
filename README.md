# Postcard

I chose to build the Post Card application.
To test this application, just simply copy and paste the code to any editor you choose. Make sure you have a server that can parse 
PHP. There are no database involved.

Bootstrap 4 css library was used to add quick nice styles to element.
The application is self-sustained, no need for external resources.
